# Cutting-edge AI: Large Language Models

Date: 21 February 2023
Time: 08:30 - 13:00
Location: Domus Bibliotheca

NORA will democratize AI by providing an accessible platform for people to gain knowledge, exchange ideas, and collaborate on projects related to AI. We are excited to launch our quarterly "Cutting-Edge AI" event series with an upcoming event at Domus Bibliotheca, Karl Johans gt. 47, Oslo, on February 21st. The meeting is open to anyone, including industry, public sector, SMEs and academia. The first part of the event will be general (08:30-10:00). For the more technically-oriented participants, we will delve deeper into the technology in the second part (10:30-13:00). 

Our focus for the first event is on Large Language Models such as ChatGPT; the technology, its implication on society and the ethical aspects. The first part of the event will be for a general audience, featuring four short presentations from Norway’s leading researchers in the field, followed by a panel discussion. For the second part, starting 10:30, we will have a technical deep dive session. The attendees can expect to delve into the technical aspects of training and fine-tuning these models, making it a unique and informative event that stands out from other events in this field. 

A light breakfast and coffee will be served for attendees before the event, from 08:00.
