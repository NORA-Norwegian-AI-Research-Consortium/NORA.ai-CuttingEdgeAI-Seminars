# Cutting-edge AI: Large Language Models

Date: 21 February 2023
Time: 08:30 - 13:00
Location: Domus Bibliotheca

NORA will democratize AI by providing an accessible platform for people to gain knowledge, exchange ideas, and collaborate on projects related to AI. We are excited to launch our quarterly "CuttingEdgeAI" event series starting with an event at Domus Bibliotheca, Karl Johans gt. 47, Oslo, on February 21st. The first part of the event is general (08:30-10:00). For the more technically-oriented participants, we will delve deeper into the technology in the second part (10:30-13:00). 

Our focus for the first event is on Large Language Models such as ChatGPT, the technology, its implication on society and the ethical aspects. The first part of the event is for a general audience, featuring five short presentations from Norway’s leading researchers in the field, followed by a panel discussion. The second part, starting at 10:45, is a technical deep dive session. The attendees can expect to delve into the technical aspects of training and fine-tuning these models, making it a unique and informative event that stands out from other events in this field.
