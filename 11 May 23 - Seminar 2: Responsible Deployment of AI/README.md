We were excited to kick off our second event as part of the CuttingEdgeAI series on May 11th, which focused on the responsible deployment of AI. The event took place at Domus Bibliotheca in Karl Johans gt. 47, Oslo.

Leading experts in the field of AI presented and discussed topics related to the utilization of AI tools, as well as ethical development and responsible deployment of AI applications. Furthermore, attendees gained insights into the technicalities of the responsible deployment of AI from leading industries in Norway during the technical deep dive session.
